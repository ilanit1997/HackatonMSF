      "We’ve been together 3.5 years, and we got married a week ago. We’ve had so many problems over the years, but we always get through them. Somehow as our wedding grew closer I found myself realizing how little time he spends present with me. We will sit in the same room, watch the same show, or eat at a restaurant. But we don’t talk. We don’t engage in anything together. I feel like we are mindlessly living side by side and he’s perfectly happy the way things are because he gets to play video games for 8 hours a day, then watch YouTube, then watch a show, rinse repeat. He’s happy in our relationship and any time I bring up my unhappiness, he just gets defensive. He says I’m attacking him by saying I’m unhappy. Today he asked me for a solution and I said we could figure it out together. He said that he doesn’t have to figure out anything because it’s my unhappiness and not his. So again I’m left to just feel all this alone…I don’t have a family. I don’t have any friends. Somewhere in the last three years I lost everything, and now I’m lost myself.…I’m so tired of life. Tired of everything. I’m not really looking for advice, I just needed to write this out. Get something small out of my head before everything just stops.\n",

      "I think my ex lied about having my child\n",
      "Hi all. Throwaway account here to get something off my chest I've been carrying for a few years and hear some other opinions. I'm a male and a few years ago I was trapped in a very complicated and emotionally abusive relationship - we both did a lot to hurt one another and I've been in therapy for a long time since, but I do strongly feel she was the aggressor in most situations and that I was doing the best I could at my age (this was right after high school). \n",
      "\n",
      "After a number of years I finally broke off the relationship and started trying to distance her from my life and move on. Things were fine for a few months before a mutual friend reached out to me and told me she was pregnant and I'm the father, though this friend was long distance and presumably only knows what she told them. I met with her in person and confronted her, she told me it was true and that she was 5 months pregnant at the time, though in hindsight she wasn't showing the way you'd expect that far along, which I didn't really think about at the time. This was devastating to me because I felt that our sex life when we were together had been abusive in nature and she would regularly guilt or manipulate me into sex that I didn't want under the implied or directly expressed threat of self-harm. She had told me while we were together that she was on birth control but, like a lot of things around that relationship, I have no idea what was true and what wasn't. I felt that I had finally escaped the relationship and the idea that this would force me to be permanently tied to her was my worst nightmare at the time - I'm ashamed of myself, but I told her that I didn't want anything to do with her or the baby and didn't even want to know their name or gender.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few months later she told me over text that the baby was born and would be living in the care of another family, and I wouldn't have to have anything to do with it. As I've aged I've felt a tremendous amount of guilt over this, as well as confusion and doubt. I'm not sure if I'll ever really be able to forgive myself if I really did reject my child, but at the same time it wouldn't be out of character if the entire thing was a lie meant to keep me from leaving (maybe the next step of the plan if I'd stayed was to fake a miscarriage and rely on me for emotional support and care). I really don't want to get back in touch with her to ask about it, and don't think she would tell me the truth if I did. I don't know anybody who was in her life at that time after we'd split up who I could ask. To my knowledge I don't have any legal right to request birth records. \n",
      "\n",
      "On paper I got what I asked for and nobody's ever reached out to me, it's been a number of years, but this is something that's eaten at me for a long time and that I'm afraid to share with anyone in my life because I'm scared it'll change the way they think of me. I'm mostly writing this to vent, and thank you for reading. If anyone has ever dealt with a similar situation I'd love to hear your thoughts, and if anyone knows of any ways I could figure out the truth (or if I should just let sleeping dogs lie) I would appreciate it. \n",

      "Hey there, I (f,31) have been out of my emotionally abusive relationship for about 7 months now. I moved back to my home country and finally finished my degree which I had postponed when I was living with my ex. I thought I would feel happy and confident after finally achieving this, but to be honest, I just feel so lost, depressed and my self confidence is at an all time low. I am staying with family now and should be looking for jobs to earn money, move out, maybe to another city and start a new life but I keep procrasinating it because I feel like I am not capable of anything and like nobody would want to hire me. Even though I dont miss him so much anymore, I still hear his voice all the time, telling me that I suck at things or that I dont do things right. A lot of my friends got married or had babies in the last years and cant really relate to what I am going through or simply dont have so much time and their own worries. Also, after not thinking about dating at all at first, I downloaded a dating app a few months ago and started texting with a guy who seemed sweet and genuine and we were writing for two months before finally meeting some days ago. Even though we had a really good connection texting, meeting in real life felt somehow awkward and I was struggling because I was super self concious while talking and felt like my answers were not smart enough. It was strange because during the date he invited me for an activity with him and his friends several times and I told him \"lets see\" because I thought it was a bit much to meet his friends so soon.. but then the next day when we were writing he said the felt like it was a nice date but no spark and send me like 20 messages basically saying he wasnt sure how he was feeling and that I should decide. I told him that I would have liked to see him again but that it sounds too complicated already and that that's not what I am looking for. He replied somewhat along the lines of, ok lets not meet again and I wished him the best and he did too saying that he was sorry and not sure if it is a good decision. Now, even though I also didnt feel a spark, I feel super rejected, hurt and confused. I feel like I am worthless, stupid (my ex told me i was all the time)  and nobody would want me ever again. I just dont know how to get better, regain my self confidence and not attach my self worth to getting validation from men. :( maybe some of you can relate or have some advice.  \n",

I will be simply existing and then get a jolt of pain from the flashbacks of the trauma. It's a feeling I have since this breakup learned to sit with and have compassion for it.

      "We live in Germany and my parents live in the UK so her having a close relationship with them was always going to be a bit harder than if they lived in the same town (or even country) as us.\n",

      "A couple of years ago my gf started to complain about my parents not contacting us enough. My parents just don't call our house claiming it's too expensive which seems more of an excuse because it's obvious they could spare a few extra pounds to call us. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the last time they visited us was 2 years ago. Which just adds to the feeling that they're disinterested.\n",
      "\n",
      "No matter how many times I ask my parents to make more of an effort, they don't. In part, I suspect this is because they have a negative view of my gf. With the exception of the honeymoon phase, the times that they visited us or we visited them, there was always some kind of incident where my girlfriend went into a mood that I was not giving her enough attention. On one occasion my parents witnessed my gf being outright verbally nasty to me because I had not stopped cooking dinner halfway to rush outside and meet my gf on her way back from work. Almost like a test to see if I would drop everything for my gf. Even though I often drop things for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the last 12 months my girlfriend appears to have ramped up her scorn for my parents and is making more of an issue of my parents disinterest. I seem to have frequent conflicts with my gf over it. For me, it's simple: if my gf wishes to have a close relationship with my parents then let's work on it. For example: She has had the occasionally whatsapp message with my mum, so she could embrace that as a means of getting closer. But she refuses claiming that it should come from my mum. She refuses to go over to the UK to visit, insisting that it is their turn to come here.\n",
      "\n",
      "So... the whole thing just ends up feeling like an excuse for my gf to fight about something. An excuse to pick on me telling me that my parents don't care or that other boyfriends made more of an effort than me. I feel powerless to do anything which is frustrating.\n",
      "\n",
      "The irony is my gf claims all she wants is a harmonious relationship but what I see is someone making a big issue of something that is not completely under my control. \n",
      "\n",
      "The issue with my parents is like an endless fountain of emotional abuse that she can direct toward me and that's why I'm writing here. I'm starting to think that the issue with my parents actually has nothing to do with my parents but more as an \"energy\" source that my gf can use to direct emotional abuse my way.\n",

I refused on both accounts and asked her to marry me (we didn't actually get married but I bought her a ring and we had a date set). We lived together for 15 months total. When the child was born she shut me out of the child's life. She was constantly paranoid I was doing something wrong that would hurt him on accident or on purpose and even accused me of sexual abuse. She was constantly driving a wedge between us where I would pick him up and she would take him from me. She then accused me of not being in my son's life. Our couple's counselor advised me to take my son and file a restraining order against her because she was abusive to me and chronically suicidal. She also very narcissistic. She constantly gaslit me and agreeing with her wouldn't even end a fight because she would say I was placating her. \n",

      "Over the past thirteen months, I made a new friend. Let's call her **Olivia** (25 F). She met me when I was in my sixth month of losing against depression, jolted me out of my head by giving a shit, struck up a conversation, and we discovered she was dating an old school chum of mine, *nom de guerre* **Michael** (25 M), whom I first was acquainted with in kindergarten. We all hung out at her place, and for a couple months, things were great. We would hang out, play board games or cards, watch movies or television, listen to music, go out to dinner or an arboretum; standard friend stuff. Over the first few months, Olivia and I became each other's best friends, by simply being in similar places regarding depression, recognizing when we needed each other's support, and caring.\n",

      "Things weren't always perfect. Olivia and Michael broke up almost half a dozen times, generally with either Michael screaming at Olivia or Olivia crying alone after getting frustrated with him and deliberately pushing Michael away. Both threatened suicide to the other after at least one of these breakups. While I never physically witnessed any of these encounters, I spent time with both parties in the aftermath, offering an ear to hear. Despite time and again of \"being completely done with him/her\" and \"wouldn't piss on her/him if they were on fire,\" they got back together again and again.\n",

      "**Incident**  \n",
      "The next day, I received word that Michael had beat Olivia, then thrown her across the room and into/through a glass cabinet. He continued to beat her while she lay in broken glass, screaming and begging for him to stop. At one point, he even paused, left the room, and then returned to continue beating her. Bruised face, chest, arms, legs, and many small cuts is what she ended up with; nothing broken, and nothing physically permanent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Michael eventually left, and Olivia called an ex-boyfriend of hers. She hadn't planned on pressing charges (stupid, in my opinion), but Michael combined his reprehensible behavior with stupidity, and turned himself in to the police, confessed to beating Olivia (saying he thought he killed her), and then continued to be a moron by cooperating with the police and kept talking without a lawyer present. \n",

He replied \"It's a long story I'd rather not get into, but I was involved in an incident a few days ago and spent the night in county jail. It was a mess, and when I told the police exactly what happened, even though I was fully honest and entirely cooperative, they treated me like a dog and changed parts of my story to make me out to seem like a criminal.\"\n",

I, on the other hand, am discarding twenty years of shallow friendship given the true face Michael revealed to Olivia. I no longer shake with rage, and am not planning any retaliation. With Michael, I'm angry, disappointed, and sad. I would like to see him punished, but I'll wait for the legal system to work. I am considering sitting down with Michael over coffee or beers, just to hear the line of reasoning that turns what I thought was a man into woman-thrashing scum, and because it's a way for Olivia to know what's going to happen with Michael.\n",

After 5 years of marriage my dad gave him 35k for a nail salon to open he's Vietnamese and does nails. Well to make a long story short . He hired a guy from Florida for addicted to meth and cocaine and Molly so I turned my own buissness into the state board bc it was filthy and the drug addict employee didn't have a nail license,he knew I was the one who turned out own shop in  he got tons of fines, took off with the guy to Florida left me with nothing..came back 3 months later sold shop behind my back gave me a whole 1200 , never paid my dad back this was back in 2015, stole my dog gave it to some Vietnamese owner of another nail salon,but I did get her back. She's my service dog. When he stole her and left I called around to every motel and found him but they wouldn't give me his room number so I had no choice but call the cops well he opened the door and they seen drugs he got arrested. I felt bad after a week bailed him out . Got a job as a direct care professional while I was stuck w him at the apt . He spray painted all my clothes and hit me in head with a ashtray, threw it bc he always threw things at me. I made his mom find him somewhere to go.   I had to get 8 stitches in my head. I'm remarried to a new guy he's amazing but I dwell on the past . He's got a gf and a 2 yr old so I thought maybe after all this time maybe he changed but no we was kinda txtn friends and meet here and there for 5mins a couple times a month but all he wanted was money and stuff. I bought his kid clothes,him clothes all kinds of stuff online that he said he'd pay me back for . He never did. Bc of covid his parents couldn't get back Vietnam so he said they was mooches and he didn't have anything giving me a pitty party Id take Boxs of food out and leave on his stairs a turkey for Christmas etc all kinds of stuff... But I caught on around Xmas and stopped meeting him for a whole 5mins to bring him a red bull he'd ask me to pick up   and pay me back he never did . Lol. After I stopped meeting him and giving him stuff he met a new friend at the nail salon the guy looked like a tweeker I met him 5mins and he didn't know I was the ex wife so as soon as he left stuff went bad he gave my number out they trolled me so bad. They'd txt my sister from fake numbers and would tell me to txt em. So I ended up changing my number technically 3x. I been mad all week and been leaving bad reviews and pics of his mugshots at the shop he works at saying he's a crack addict and will cut someone and they'll get a bad infection and it'll be there fault and as soon as 20 ppl see it they take it down smh . I think that's what makes me mad they think it's some great guy that does there nails and he's a manipulative, explosive bipolar disorder nut case . If anyone wants to see my head where he hit me message me I got a pic of it still . He threatened to lie and tell my husband stuff . Txtd me from 100 texting apps him and his friends at work smh . Said he'd tell my husband stuff if I didn't give him money and then after I said that's blackmail extortion he quit txtn and left me alone bc that's a felony. That was 3 weeks ago. I already suffer from so many disorders and anxiety he made the last 3 months hell. But everything was good till he met a new guy friend at work. So we managed be friends 7 months and then it all went crazy . I just didn't wanna go my whole life with no closure hating him I just wanted amends.

We were doing volunteer work, he got upset about something, he quit, I tried to get him to come back but he refused to answer my calls. Eventually he stormed into the building, and screamed, “You!

This really shows I’m dating a boy, not a man, because you don’t get to control me and I won’t deal with this.” I hung up the call, and he apologized and said he was joking and I could do whatever I wanted with my hair.

I wanted to sort of vent about my own experiences a bit and reach out to other abuse survivors because the area in which I live still operates, to a degree, under the mentality of \"men can't be abused.\" There are no support groups outside of my church which are able to help with this but I feel a need to connect with someone, anyone, who understands what I have been and am still in many ways going through.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the middle of October I left my abusive home, after a 13 year long relationship that was abusive from day one. The abuse was almost never physical, but was frequent, nearly constant. Name calling, negative contrasting, belittling, gaslighting, financial abuse, infidelity, public shaming, DARVO, mocking, love bombing (this one was especially dangerous for me, as I am very sensitive and stupid enough to trust and forgive anyone for anything) making fun of me for crying when my brother committed suicide, I could go on and on and give hundreds of examples. But as a man, I'm not \"supposed\" to have this problem. I've gone to attorneys about this who rolled their eyes at me and said \"get over it.\" Police officers have laughed at me for coming to them with my issues. I've had people look me in the eye and say \"you weren't abused\" as if they knew what happened daily in my home more than I did. \n",

So I come here to ask for wisdom, and guidance, and help, and possibly to give what little I can offer to others who are in pain. Who know what it is like to be afraid all day and all night.

      "If I could give one piece of advice to anyone in an abusive relationship other than \"leave as quickly as you can as soon as it is safe for you to do so\" then it would simply be \"do not play the game your abuser wants you to play; they delight in pushing you until you do something bad that they can use against you. If they hit you, do not hit them back; if they call you names, do not call them names back. Do not let them make you do what they do, because nothing makes them happier than that kind of control and power over you.\"\n",

      "I (25F) was groomed by my mentor at work (37M)\n",
      "I'm still trying to understand how this could be true. I thought the word grooming only applied to victims under 18, but my therapist is helping me learn and understand. I'm an adult, so I feel like I should have known better than to be deceived like I was. By the end, he had complete and total control over my emotions. I struggle with imposter syndrome at work, feeling like I was only hired because of minority hiring initiatives, and being quick to tell myself that I'm not really qualified. But he is the one who helped me through those thoughts. He helped me see that my only true weakness is lack of confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I trusted him completely and we became good friends which lasted for several months. But then I found out he had always had a crush on me. I had no idea. Later he would tell me that he fell in love with me during our very first conversation, when I was still an intern. He made me feel so special, and I fell in love with that feeling. He shared his own insecurities with me and I helped him. I loved that I could help him how he had helped me. I loved feeling that emotional connection with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he made me uncomfortable physically, I would ignore the feeling. I didn't want to ruin the relationship by making him feel bad, so I let it continue. I tried to communicate my boundaries to him, and he pretended to respect me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I forgot to mention that he's married. And he has a 2-year-old daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "He always wanted more from me. He was always testing the waters with me, under the guise of being honest with me and telling me how he feels. He coerced me emotionally to reciprocate his feelings. It is the most confusing thing I've ever experienced. Everything was in secrecy as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "The crazy thing is, he really didn't realize he was doing it. He didn't realize he was controlling and changing my emotions. He didn't realize that I had totally lost sight of myself and my own identity. He is narcissistic. He suffered through his own childhood trauma, and his defense mechanism was to do whatever it takes to make himself feel good. Always. And that's still what he does. His own feelings are always first. He needs other people to help him feel good about himself and tell him he's a good person. And I provided that for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at the end, he sexually abused me. Without a doubt. Because of my religious beliefs, I'm waiting until marriage to have sex. And he knew that. But he thought he was entitled to try anyway. And something in his sick twisted mind let him think that it would be ok to try to have sex with me without explicitly asking first. He somehow thought I wouldn't be upset. He saw my boundaries as challenges...walls to be broken down. \n",
      "\n",
      "He is a manipulator. Other people's emotions are like putty to him. He uses emotional appeals to make people want to help him and want to be nice to him. As soon as he realizes he can't control how someone sees him or feels about him, he has very strong emotional reactions. He turns to other indirect methods of control. He'll start damaging that person's reputation in very subtle ways. Ways that he can't easily be called out for. He'll start turning other people in the office against the person that made him feel bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is an abuser because he was abused and he never properly dealt with it. And that is not my fault. I had every reason to trust him, and it's not my fault that I couldn't see the patterns that would have revealed his true character.\n",

For comparison my childhood was marked with taking care of my parents and creating a life for myself, being financially independent and taking care of my mental health consistently. He never really understood mental health like anxiety on a personal level and so never really understood me, at least that’s how I felt during the relationship.

We communicate really well when we don’t agree on things and have supported eachother through really tough times. He is a really genuine and I do love him. However, I was going on his phone bc mine was dead to watch Netflix and I noticed a weird app, I clicked onto it and it was a chatting app. I saw one message with a girl and a video call that was 10 minutes. The messages between them were sexual. I saw he had the app for 3 months but the messages only lasted a day. I was devastated but decided to talk to him the next day.\n",

      "I have just started dating a new partner this month, and I’m feeling concerned about how much I’ve been thinking about my ex-partner throughout.\n",
      "\n",
      "For context, my ex and I started dating last year during my first year of university. We dated from September until May. He was my first love, and I would describe it as very passionate and intense. It was a near-perfect whirlwind romance, and I began picturing a future with him pretty soon after we started dating. The relationship began to turn toxic around January, as he gradually became more and more jealous, controlling and angry. Eventually, he became emotionally abusive, with lots of hot-and-cold behaviour. When it was good, it was GREAT (the attention, the sex, etc.). But when it was bad, it was awful. But even though he was hurting me, it had come to a point where I couldn’t picture my life without him, so I was quick to forgive him. And ultimately, I’m ashamed to admit he was the one who cut off contact for good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The breakup took an extreme toll on me and I have been in therapy since. For months I was experiencing flashbacks to the abuse and became quite reckless to cope. Every time I tried to go on dates with someone new, it felt like I didn’t have nearly the same spark with them as I had with my ex. It has felt like a long grieving process, and I’m beginning to feel like it’s a little too long, and that I still am unable to be in a relationship. Which brings me to today.\n",

      "I met my new partner (19F) a couple months ago in class and we quickly developed a friendship. At some point I realized that I was interested in her, so I asked her to hang out, and the rest has been history. She is lovely. She’s so kind, she has a good sense of humour and she’s really beautiful, and I’m definitely attracted to her. However, I still find myself comparing the way I feel about her to the way that I felt about my ex. Here are the main differences: I don’t think about her constantly, I don’t want to be around her every minute of the day, I don’t fantasize about a future with her, I don’t feel as much excitement and nervousness around her. Another thing to note is that we have just begun to be sexually active, so the sex hasn’t been mind-blowing, and I hate to admit it, but I’ve found myself fantasizing about my ex at times.\n",

      "I was struggling with my new boyfriend. To summarize, I left my husband this time last year because he cheated on me (its a wild story, I'm waiting for my divorce to finalize before sharing it). Since then I was dating a man (we were officially together for 5 months), and I kept feeling deeply unsettled. I thought it was because I wasn't ready. I kept pushing through, telling myself that I was just anxious because of what my ex husband did to me. I was going to therapy and communicating with him every step of the way so he felt comfortable and he knew I was doing what I needed to do to be with him. Turns out, my new boyfriend was cheating!! I got DMs from a girl a few days ago, so grateful for her. So, moral of the story is, if it doesn't feel right it isn't right. This gives me so much affirmation to trust how I feel, the body always knows. Our instincts are strong. I feel so grateful that I know this now and can fully move on before investing more time and derailing more of my healing for a loser. Obviously I haven't broken my patterns yet and I got into a relationship too soon. There's no fast track through this, and the only way to be ready for a good partner is to heal from a bad one.\n",

No. Cheating  changed my relationship, the relationship that was after, is what changed me. The more I thought about this, the more I felt that I really need to let it out. Like, the feeling is urgent, like I might explode if I don't tell someone!

Later, he started accusing me of cheating everytime I was away from home for more than 1-2 hrs. \"Hope that dick is good\", was the kind of texts I would receive when visiting my mother or aunt, without a kid in tow, and he'd constantly try to catch me in a lie.\n",

There was always a somewhat reasonable excuse, and I trusted him and believed him. This is how my boundaries were pushed, just a tiny bit at a time, so I wasn't even aware when they eventually fell off the face of the Earth. \n",

He started degrading me in sexual ways and this was NOT something that was a part of our normal sex life, and he'd put boogers in my hair when I slept (yes, you read that right). This abuse continued *well* past his physical affair - I didn't actually find out about the cheating until after I left him, about 10 years later. He also entertained multiple online affairs around this time and this continued throughout the years until the end. I'm sure he just plain hated me after a couple of years. That's certainly how it felt, despite him saying \"I love you\".\n",

I wasn't supposed to actually consent and participate. Do I need to mention how sleep depraved I was? He could do this ALL night and patiently wait till I fell properly asleep again, before trying again. And again. And again. Several nights in a row. I **loved** it when he spent the night somewhere else! Sleep torture is real, y'all! He was made very aware that his \"advances\" was unwelcome and he was kicked out of the bedroom.

I'll probably be forever damaged to some extent, I still haven't been able to start or maintain a meaningful romantic connection, despite it being more than a handful of years since I dumped his ass. *This* is why one shouldn't make their first relationship the forever relationship.

I hesitate to mark this as progress, since it's only been about a month since D-Day, but I am now coming out of the initial shock and burst of anger/despair that came along with it. I have been reading posts ever since the very first days of my relationship being over, and wish I had found this community sooner. I would have ended this relationship 4 years ago if that was the case. Being able to read these posts every day really helped in such a extraordinary way that I would not of originally expected. I don't have any social media, and I don't usually comment, but I want to say thank you to everyone who has posted and commented and has been in this community. It has been great to have you in my pocket every day, and just know I am here as well,  right along with you all, and rooting for every single one of you, truly and completely. \n",

      "As previously mentioned, I did not have any social media, which definitely tied into my \"downfall\". I also was easily convinced that i was the problem, and have a knack for trying to be as easy going as possible. I definitely blamed myself, in the begining. I do not count myself as naive, I am almost laughably wary of the whole world,  but I did trust my SO more than anyone in my life, and it was used against me. I naturally blamed myself in the begining for this mess, but I no longer do most days, which is also why I'm marking this as progress. \n",

I went no contact after D-Day, and SO isn't even aware of how much I know. The last thing spoken between us was me saying I don't promise reconciliation even if they get their life in order, but they still said they were planning on it, because being with me is what they wanted. I  told them I was cutting contact, and to not expect anything. I was already moved in family by this point, and they were flying back to their residence.  I was so livid it was beyond anger. Betrayal does such a funny thing to ordinary anger. Its such a sick knife to the gut.\n",

Received a text afterwards pretty much saying they can't believe I would end the relationship over one weekend, and one thing they did for themselves (I already made them aware the relationship was destroyed NOT because of one weekend, but all the actions leading up to the \"one weekend\" occuring) and telling me they are sorry I ever \"agreed\" (what an interesting choice of words, no?) to being this relationship and goodbye. I was promptly blocked. The time we talked previous to this message, they admitted to realizing how much they gaslit me and controlled me, and how much they messed up. I guess they had a talk with some people in their life and in the 5 days of no contact, the Clouds Of Delusion formed again and they went back to thinking they were the victim and did nothing wrong.

He said he would ruin all my friendships and everything in my life but so far he hasn't done anything. could this all be a part of his plan to try and hoover again and convince me he's a nice person so i have nothing to use against him or is he just love bombing the new supply right now?\n",

I know he has severe OCD but his lack of impulse control, deception (lying, cheating), lack of remorse, strong sense of entitlement, paranoia, aggression, and disregard for rules have led me to think he has at least one Cluster B personality disorder or traits. I think it's NPD (covert) but it can be ASPD - they are similar but different.\n",

He said that hes just playing them so i was a bit reassured. However, these hangouts were usally him and the 2 girls alone in his house doing whatsoever. I was a bit paranoid so i just went over to check. He was angry that i had came over and asked me to leave, threatening to leave me. I begged and cried to ask him to not leave, in the exchange of him to stop hanging around with those 2 girls. He agreed and dropped them. I thought this will be the end but a few weeks later, he hung around with a girl alone and i only caught them when they entered a classroom filled with no one. I was shocked and confronted him on the spot. Instead of being remorseful, he placed the blame on me for hanging out with my new friends who he actually known them. I was confused and hurt as he was in the wrong but blaming me instead. I just left them there and he texted me apology messages at night. I forgave him. Few months passed, the cycle continues. He had cheated on me twice but i was nice enough to give him chances, thinking he would change. But he did not. He eventually told me he wanted to break up and i cried, begging him to not leave. In the end, i decide to cut off contact with him and left my old friendgroup he was in (they also had caused harm towards me). 2 of my other friends also left the friend group together with me and im glad they did. After leaving, i finally realised my ex had manipulated and gaslighted me during our relationship, constantly blaming and threatening me. Im in a good relationship currently and according to my 2 friends, my ex went into depression after his new girlfriend left him and he is really regretful about whatever he did to me. I will never forgive him and thats final.\n",

When I convinced him to talk to me, I begged him for just one more chance even though I never improved with the other chances he gave me because I didn’t realize all that I was doing wrong.

So we met online and were in a long distance relationship (fyi I am a teenager and it’s my first ever relationship). This was an unexplored territory for me and I believed everything he said like a sorry ass puppy. Once he got really sick and was admitted to the hospital and he never told me what actually happened cause idk for some reason he liked to keep every personal detail a secret (which is like a HUGE HUGE red flag and I am obviously colour blind). Well anyways he writes poems so he sent me a poem. It was really bad handwriting and it was basically him saying that even tho his leg hurts and he can barely write he still needs me. Keep in mind that the last line had a word that I couldn’t understand which at the time I thought was my name. The line basically said …. I love you. Now STUPID, IDIOT, FUCKING DELUSIONAL ME thought ‘aww he’s so cute, even tho he is in pain he wrote me a poem’. I always told him how much that poem meant to me. \n",
      "Fast forward to a few months later when we were going through a rough patch (now that I think of it when were we not) and we were like breaking it off and then getting back together. We had made up from a fight which was about his ex. So I was really fucking insecure of him still being head over heels in love with her which he always denied and me being me believed it (at that time it was at its PEAK). He was sending me pictures from his gallery from the past. He would do it a lot idk why and most of the times it was something related to his ex. He sent me the poem and I just knew that this man does not even remember that he had once sent me this exact poem claiming that he wrote it for me. I casually asked ‘when did you write it?’ And he said ‘umm maybe 2020’…….we started dating at the end of 2022 and that was the year they had broken up. I knew it was over for that bitch so I started with ‘funny thing uk you sent it to me when you were in the hospital and said that it was for me but I remember us meeting in 2022 and not in 2020’. Well it turns out that the word which I thought was my name was actually a name he had for her, sort of like an inside joke idk. That day I realised how fucking blind I had been and that was the thing that fucking ensured that I won’t care about him anymore.\n",

He’s put a huge amount of thought and energy into this from the start and has been generally great. But since we agreed to make it official last week I’ve heard much less from him. We still speak every day but much more infrequently, he has less to say and conversation feels more bland. He rescheduled a date night thing three times. He’s ignoring some of my messages.

      "My worries are putting a label on it (which was something he asked to do incidentally) has stressed him or made him realise he’s not as into this as he thought, or now the ‘chase’ is over he doesn’t care as much… why pursue me and push for this so much if when it happens doesn’t want to spend much time with me. It’s like he’s suddenly decided to play it really cool at the weirdest moment.

      "I recently figured out that my gf before we officially in a relationship went to a club and kissed 3 guys in the same night. This was about 3 months into us talking everyday, going on dates around 1-2x per week, FaceTiming, me picking her up from work, driving her to all our dates, and buying her flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know I never explicitly stated the word \"exclusive\", but am I wrong to feel hurt by this? The truth is I didn't even find out from her even when I asked her how her night went and if she did anything that night. Out mutual friend told me because she felt bad for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, I never stated those words, but I always mentioned to her how much I like her and would like to keep seeing her. Not only that, but like texting consistently should mean that I am into you and that those feelings are somewhat reciprocated?\n",
      "\n",
      "She has done other things as well, like meeting with her ex behind my back for lunch to get her closure and lied to me about it so part of me is suspicious of her already. \n",

      "Keep in mind we are just into 3 months of dating. \n",

      "Infidelity\n",
      "My ‘boyfriend’ (21M) cheated on his girlfriend (22F) with me (23F)\n",
      "  feel sick writing this. **My supposed ‘boyfriend’ was in a relationship with me for 3 months while he had another girlfriend.** Let me provide some context: I met the person who was my boyfriend in October of last year, and after a lot of lovebombing from his side, we started a relationship. From the beginning, I was very clear about my disdain for infidelity. At this point, he mentioned that he had recently ended a long-term relationship, which bothered me, but I thought it wouldn’t matter because he assured me it was over.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "  e to the psychological abse, I suffered during October and part of November, I ended up hospitalized in a mental health facility. It was during this time that I discovered what I initially believed was an affair with his ex, but in reality, I was the other woman. Learning this destroyed me, especially considering my fragile mental state as I had been in the hospital for 2 or 3 days. Eventually, after two weeks in the mental health facility, we had a conversation where I chose to play the villain so that he would leave me alone. I knew that otherwise, his obsessive personality wouldn’t let me go.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "  er the next two months, we had very little contact. He continued hoovering, and I kept telling him we needed to wait because I was afraid to reject him. During this time, we were separated due to the end-of-semester holidays, and I explicitly told him that if he got close to his ex again, he could forget about my existence.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "  early, he didn’t care, because last night I found out that they were together during those 2 months, which means I was always the **OW**. Learning this ignited something within me. The next thing I knew, I was waiting for him to fall asleep (long story) so I could gather all the evidence of his double infidelity from his phone.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Before learning about the infidelity, I wanted Karma to take care of him. However, after discovering how he attempted to come back and hurt me and realizing that being unfaithful to me wasn’t enough, he made me do the same with him. Now, I seek revenge. I’ve already planned something to expose him in front of her and both of their families. I wish I could do worse to make him feel the pain of my betrayal.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I caught her in 4k. Have you caught your partner cheating on video?\n",
      "So long story short. My fiance worked in a lab within a warehouse I owned. The company she worked for was a separate company than my own but we operated under the same roof. \n",
      "\n",
      "I received a call from my mother (Co owner of the warehouse with myself) to look at the cameras at a certain time. To which I saw a recording of my fiance cheating on me with one of her bosses. Going threw a month of videos I compiled over 30gbs of 4k video of act of infidelity. \n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't do anything cool with the evidence. Simply saved them and showed it to whom ever asked. Also sent them to my fiance and her boss. I posted about all this in more detail before. Feel free to find it to understand the situation more. But I don't want to talk about my situation that much on this post. \n",
      "\n",
      "All this got me thinking. You know those cool videos in movies or on YouTube that people do to get back at cheaters. They will do something hilarious with the evidence. An example would be like a video of a groom showing evidence of cheating at the wedding type of thing. I really wish I would have done something like that when I had the chance but my approach was lame. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways let's hear your stories. I wanna hear about those badass moments you were able to get back at those cheaters and home wreckers. How did you use your evidence to give these scum what they deserve! \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm hoping for this to be a positive post. I'm sure anyone who has been cheated on would love a good revenge story. Please keep it this positive and no judgment to whom ever post. \n",
      "Thanks! Looking forward to reading some killer stories. \n",

      "Recovering alcoholic husband trying to cheat in a recovery app\n",
      "My husband has been sober for almost 2 years now. Right before he went into a program was when I found out he had been cheating through our entire relationship. He gets through it, gets out, clean as whistle. There have been slip ups with tik Tok thirst traps and porn addiction, but I noticed he had been using his sobriety app more recently and I look and he's commenting stuff like \"great job! Yeah you can do it! I'm here if you ever need to talk blah blah\" on multiple girls posts who are on the app for masturbation or sex addiction. That means he sought them out based on their addiction to find their selfies/posts and comment on them. I am at my wits end. I just wanna know, has anyone else experienced that?\n",

      "So I wanted to share what happen in my marriage and how miserable I fell now. Sorry for my English too. (Its my 2nd language)\n",
      "\n",
      "Me 33y M and 37y F are together for over 15 yeras now. Married for 8 yeras. Have 4 yeras old daughter. \n",
      "\n",
      "We live in UK , but originally we are from Poland. Our relationship was often up and down, we had very good times together and some bad too. We weren't perfect that's for sure but every time we wanted to end up being together,  our hearts were telling us to stay and continue. \n",
      "\n",
      "Everything started when I decided to move from Poland to UK , wanted to have better life there , hoping my wife would join me and we can bulit a new family together. She agreed. I was without her for 1.5y , then she came and we started living together again. Everything was very difficult for me at the beginning,  getting new job, language barriers etc. I had saved quite a bit chunk of money before my wife joined me , just to make sure when she arrives we are secure enough to buy a car, rent a house etc. Couple months in , we where good, happy together, having plans to have children. \n",
      "\n",
      "One day I was getting up to work and saw a notification on her phone. Message was \"Hi honey\". Bear in mind a have never ever looked into my wife phone. I did it first time and discovered a full conversation between her and some guy from her last work in Polnad. It wasn't looking very bad, but definitely red flag. He was asking what she is wearing and similar. She also told him to dont text her that early because her husband can see it. There was a lot \"Hi honey how are you\" etc. I told her I know everything and she denied she was cheating, she told me thats only a friend from work and this just the way how they text each other. I didn't believe her and I was asking about that guy for past 8 yeras many times trying to get truth from my wife. She was often very upset about my questions telling me \"what do you think I am?, what you think I was doing with this guy, I would never cheat on you, that was only a firend from work\" I have never believed her and since that happened I have regularly checked my wife phone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next couple years living in UK we get a house on mortgage and our daughter was born. We were quite happy but I have started very bad problems with my back. Long story short I have a condition called ankylosing spondylitis which cause an every day pain in my back and affecting my life badly. In short my spine is fusing together, there is inflammation in my body constantly. First 4 yeras when my daughter was born were a real struggle for me. My wife was often supportive for me but over time she had enough of me , seeing me in pain etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 3 yeras ago she started to text a new guy from her work. Some texts where about to go to hotel one day and she was saying how she is missing him. Again we have a chat about this and she told me it is just stupid way how she talk to guys and she fell sorry and that would never happen again. You can call me a proper fool now. I did believe here but I really felt bad and because we have a little child I didn't want to get apart and divorce. \n",
      "\n",
      "5 weeks ago I have discovered she is texting with someone again, but this time she was deleting messages more often and I couldn't figure out what is she up to. I have a plan and I told her that maybe we should try to meet someone new and then  get a divorce because we argue a lot and I dont know how long we can live like that. What I really wanted was to see if she is doing something again and boy I was right...\n",

See previous posts for more context but long story short I found out he was sleeping with prostitutes and outside a short conversation about the dog he had gotten me shortly before I have refused to talk to him since then and it’s been about 3 months.
